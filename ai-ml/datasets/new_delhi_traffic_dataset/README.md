# 🛣️ New Delhi Traffic Probe Count & Analytics Dataset (2024)

**Created by: Ryan Madhuwala (RAW), Founder of Garudex Labs**

## 📦 Overview

This dataset is a comprehensive, large-scale traffic analysis and urban infrastructure resource capturing **probe count data** and **urban metrics** across **New Delhi** and surrounding regions, featuring a **15,000+ km road network**.

It includes both **generalized annual traffic analytics for 2024** and **detailed probe count data from August 11–30, 2024**, a period rich in cultural and traffic variation due to Indian national festivals like **Independence Day, Rakshabandhan, and Janmashtami**, alongside the **monsoon season** — making this an invaluable dataset for mobility research, urban planning, AI traffic forecasting, smart city infrastructure, and congestion pattern modeling.
